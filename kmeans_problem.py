    K-Means Clustering Problem for Qubots.
    
    Given a set of observations along several dimensions, the goal is to partition these observations
    into k clusters so as to minimize the total variance. The variance of a cluster is defined as the
    sum of squared Euclidean distances between each observation in the cluster and the cluster's centroid.

      A list of length k, where each element is a list of observation indices (0-indexed) assigned to that cluster.
