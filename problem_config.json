    "description": "Given a sample of observations along several dimensions, the goal is to partition these observations into k clusters. Each cluster is defined by its centroid (the arithmetic mean of the observations in that cluster) and the variance of a cluster is the sum of squared Euclidean distances between each observation and its centroid. The objective is to minimize the total variance across all clusters.",
